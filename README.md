## Introduction

The AI-Powered Web Automation Testing Assistant is a cutting-edge tool designed to revolutionize the process of creating and managing web automation tests. By leveraging artificial intelligence, this system automates the creation of CSS selector test cases, Gherkin feature files, and Python automation scripts, while also providing comprehensive QA reviews.

Developed by Richardson Gunde, this tool aims to streamline the workflow of Software Development Engineers in Test (SDETs) and QA professionals, significantly reducing the time and effort required in the test creation and maintenance process.

## Features

- Automated generation of detailed CSS selector test cases
- Creation of BDD-style Gherkin feature files from test cases
- Development of Python-based web automation scripts
- Comprehensive QA review and integration checks
- User-friendly Streamlit interface for easy interaction
- Scalable and maintainable test suite structure

## System Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

#### Agents and Tasks

### Agents:
1. CSS Selector Test Case Specialist
2. BDD Gherkin Specialist
3. SDET Automation Expert
4. Senior QA Strategist

### Tasks:
1. CSS selector test case writing
2. Gherkin feature file creation
3. Python automation script development
4. QA review and integration

For detailed descriptions of each agent and task, please refer to the `agents.py` and `tasks.py` files.

## Output
